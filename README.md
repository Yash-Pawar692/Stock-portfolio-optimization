Created an optimization model that creates a portfolio by choosing stocks and their quantities from a large pool of equities based on their futures data and estimated profits. The user can input their budget and the optimizer will choose the stocks that will help the user gain maximum profits. We have also added certain constraints to the model in order to diversify the portfolio. Initially, we created the model in excel and then built the model in python so as to scale up the model. In python, we can input a huge pool of stocks and optimal stocks will be selected.
